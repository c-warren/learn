# learn

Inspired by similar repos from [charliegerard](https://github.com/charliegerard/dev-notes/blob/master/README.md), [husam-e](https://github.com/husam-e/tils/blob/main/README.adoc), [jbranchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til?tab=readme-ov-file). 

This repository is a collection of things that I've learned, read about, or want to put into practice. Writing them here is a way to help me commit it to memory, reference it in future, and generate discussion with others on their thoughts about these topics.

Everything learned here has come from some other source - from reading, working, or osmosis. Where possible the author has been cited (along with any quotes deemed pertinent) and is not intended to be represented as my own work.
